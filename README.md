# Requirement Engineer

This repository contains the work of the Requirement Engineer project, which encompasses both personal and group contributions.

## Personal Work

### Software Analysis
In the realm of personal work, one of the key aspects is software analysis. This involves studying the software environment, understanding its components, and identifying the challenges and opportunities it presents. This analysis is crucial for making informed decisions and recommendations.

### Prototype Design
Another essential task is the design of prototypes for the project. This includes creating visual representations of the software, outlining its features, and demonstrating its functionality. Prototyping is an important step in the development process and helps stakeholders visualize the end product.

### Business Process Modeling
As a requirement engineer, you'll be responsible for defining the business processes that the software will support. This entails creating clear and comprehensive business process models using methodologies such as BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) or activity diagrams. These models help in understanding and communicating the workflow of the software.

## Group Work

### Requirements Gathering Plan
In addition to personal tasks, the project involves group work. A significant aspect of this collaboration is to plan and execute the requirements gathering process. This includes defining the scope of the project, identifying key stakeholders, and creating a strategy to collect and document software requirements. Effective requirements gathering is critical to the success of the project.

Please refer to the specific directories and files within this repository for more detailed information on each aspect of the project.

Thank you for your interest in the Requirement Engineer project.
